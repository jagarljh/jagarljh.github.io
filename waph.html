            <p>Overview of the Lab 1 : From this Lab 1, I have gone through the application of wireshark tool and how the HTTP Requests and Responses are examined by using Wireshark with web server.Similarly how the HTTP requests and responses using telnet and wireshark application with web server.Then, with basic web application programming, have gone through creating of programs and processed with gcc compiler and also created a PHP web application and handson exercises related to PHP and also there is a chance of understanding how the HTTP POST and HTTP GET works and similarities and differences between POST and GET.I am attaching my Github lab 1 URL in markdown notation.

            <p>Overview of Lab2: From this lab2, I have gone through the creation of basic html page with tags and headshot and creation of forms with interactions and developed the inlined javascript code to show the date and setup the javascript code to display a digital clock and also the analog clock. Using js file and html code displayed the email when clicked and in task 2, I have gone through the part of AJAX, where process to get user input when a button is clicked and send a Ajax Get request using onclick button ajax.echo to the web application and the responses are recorded.Then for css, displayed the page in inline, internal and external and for jQuery, I have added the jquery library in my page and sending the ajax get to web application and post to web application and responses are recorded and with using jquery ajax written the js code and send the request and recorded the response of a joke from the api and using fetch method call the api with user input and responses are recorded.Im attaching my Github lab2 URL in markdown notation. https://github.com/jagarljh/waph-jagarljh/tree/main/labs/lab2/README.md.</p>

            <h2>Hackathons</h2>
            <p>Hackathon 1- Cross-site Scripting Attacks and Defenses

Overview of the Assignment: From this hackathon assignment, I have gone through two tasks mainly task 1 with attacks and task 2 with defenses. In task 1, I performed cross scripting attacks on various levels to understand various vulnerabilitites and finding of vulnerabilities. For level 0 and Level 1 there is no code guess and proceed with script and alert tags. Whereas, for level 2 to level 6 i have followed to guess the source code and findout where the vulnerability is exploited. In task 2, I have followed the defenses and identified the input data channels and implemented input validations and encode the data before injected the code in the interface.I am attaching the github URL here:https://github.com/jagarljh/waph-jagarljh/edit/main/hackathons/hackathon1/README.md</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>I created my professional portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring distinct sections highlighting my qualifications, technical skills, work experience, and projects. The design is clean, utilizing CSS for styling and deployed on GitHub Pages for accessibility.

For non-technical requirements, I integrated Bootstrap to ensure a responsive design. The Bootstrap Navbar and navigation links provide a user-friendly experience, adapting to different screen sizes. Cards, containers, and utility classes maintain a consistent layout.

In terms of technical requirements, I implemented basic JavaScript code for features like a digital and analog clock, interactive email display, and user recognition through cookies. Additionally, I used React.js to display technical skills dynamically.

Two public APIs were integrated: the jokeAPI for humor and the Weatherbit API for real-time weather information. These elements add interactivity and provide engaging content for visitors.

Overall, my portfolio combines design aesthetics, dynamic content, and technical features to present a comprehensive overview of my skills and experiences.</p>
